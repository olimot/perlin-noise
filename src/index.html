      <h1>Perlin Noise</h1>
      <p>
        Perlin noise is a gradient-based procedural noise function developed by
        Ken Perlin, widely used in computer graphics for generating
        natural-looking textures, terrains, and other organic patterns. It
        produces smooth, continuous variations by interpolating gradients at
        lattice points, resulting in a coherent and visually appealing
        randomness. Unlike pure randomness, Perlin noise is deterministic and
        repeatable, making it ideal for applications like terrain generation,
        cloud rendering, and animations where consistent patterns are essential.
        Its flexibility and scalability allow it to be adapted to different
        dimensions and customized for various use cases, from simple 2D textures
        to complex 3D volumetric effects.
